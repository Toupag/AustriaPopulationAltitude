The workflow in the preprocessing of the data is the following:
First the csv's are loaded. These are used in order to get a DataFrame that has the population data and human readable columns for the Bezirk and Year.
Secondly every Bezirk is used in order to query DBpedia and the the altitude.
Lastly all this data is merged and saved as a new csv that includes the population per Bezirk and the altitude of the main city of every Bezirk.
