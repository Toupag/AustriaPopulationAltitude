# AustriaPopulationAltitude

This experiment aims to explore the altitude at which Austrians live.

### Prior to running the experiment make sure that the following folders exist:

    data/raw - Folder to store the external datasets
    reports/figures - Target folder for generated correlation plot

### Data Sources

    Population since 1869 via https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/3bfba412-7053-3a60-937a-8c3dd2c71294
    MissingHM data - manually created and added to this repository


The cited datasources have already been added to this repository.

### Follow these instructions if you want to use updated versions of these datasource:

    Download CSV files to folder data/raw
    Set paths to CSV files in notebook 01-PopulationAltitude_Preprocessing.ipynb by changing the values when reading the csv files.

### Running the code

To run the code in this repository you will need to have access to a machine running python (at least version 3.5) and pip.

Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required dependencies.

Once the dependencies have been installed, start the jupyter notebook server via jupyter notebook and open http://localhost:8888.

In the notebooks folder you'll find the following notebooks:

#### 01-PopulationAltitude_Preprocessing.ipynb

Running this notebook generates a dataset consisting of every Bezirk in Austria with its according population and the elevation of the main city of teh Bezirk.

The resulting dataset is located at data/Population2011_altitude.csv

#### 02_visualization.ipynb

This notebook takes the data generated by running 01-PopulationAltitude_Preprocessing.ipynb as input and generates a plot to visualize the altitude levels at which Austrians typically live.

The resulting plot is stored at reports/figures/01.png and reports/figures/01.png
